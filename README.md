# 🏡 EstateIQ – Bangalore House Price Prediction Web Application

EstateIQ is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts residential property prices in Bangalore based on key property attributes such as location, total square feet, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms. The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to regression model training, evaluation, and deployment through an interactive Flask web application.

# 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses the **Bengaluru House Price Dataset** for model training and evaluation.

- **Source (Kaggle):** [Bengaluru House Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/viveksingh0510/house-price-prediction-bangalore)

Dataset Characteristics:

- Bangalore residential properties
- Multiple locations across the city
- Property size (sq. ft.)
- BHK
- Bathrooms
- Property prices

---

# 📥 Prediction Inputs

The prediction model estimates house prices using the following property features:

- Total Square Feet
- Number of Bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of Bathrooms
- Location

These features are processed by the trained regression model to estimate the property's market value.

---

# 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The raw housing dataset underwent several preprocessing steps before model training:

- Missing value handling
- Location normalization
- Outlier removal
- Feature engineering
- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- Train-test split

# 🧪 Machine Learning Models & Results

| Model | R² Score |
|--------|----------|
| Linear Regression | **0.8234** |
| Lasso Regression | 0.8128 |
| Ridge Regression | **0.8234** |

**Evaluation Metric:** R² (Coefficient of Determination), where values closer to **1.0** indicate better predictive performance.

### Final Model

Although Linear Regression and Ridge Regression achieved the same R² score, **Ridge Regression** was selected as the final model due to its L2 regularization, which improves generalization and reduces the impact of multicollinearity.

---

# ⚙️ Development Workflow

## Model Development

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering & outlier removal
- Regression model training and evaluation
- Final Ridge Regression model selection

## Deployment & Integration

- Model serialization using Pickle (`.pkl`)
- Flask backend integration
- Property input form handling
- Real-time prediction rendering
