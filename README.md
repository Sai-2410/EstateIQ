# 🏡 EstateIQ – Bangalore House Price Prediction Web Application

A Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts house prices in Bangalore using property-related features such as location, total square feet, BHK, and bathrooms.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression model evaluation, and deployment through an interactive web interface.

# 🧪 Machine Learning Models & Results

| Model | R² Score |
|--------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.8234 |
| Lasso Regression | 0.8128 |
| Ridge Regression | 0.8234 |

### ✅ Final Model Selection

Although Linear Regression achieved similar accuracy, **Ridge Regression** was selected for its better generalization capability, stability against overfitting, and improved handling of multicollinearity.
